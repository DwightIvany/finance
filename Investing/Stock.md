To recreate, or simplify what I had done with Stock before.

So each time to define exits.
If stock performs worse than 30% than S&P within the first year.
If stock performs worse than 50% than S&P within the first three years.
Any time after four years and I mostly think negatively.
Anytime I think ethics and honesty are a hard fail.
My worst stock, or smallest position anytime I cross the simple dozen.

Define the too good to be true
