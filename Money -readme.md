# Emergency Fund
We need to re-shape the intention of emergency fund, into a better plan B

Emergency is an event that we had no way of knowing it was coming, which has a major impact on our family, if we do not cover it. (Examples)
- Insurance deductibles
- Atypical medical
- Accidents
- Job loss or cut back
- Atypical car maintenance (blown engine, transmission, towing)

Family rules to consider:
-Always agree when we are using it
-Sleep on the decision (when practical) 
There may be exceptions where that is not practical, like a medical emergency in a foreign country.
