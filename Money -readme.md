# Emergency Fund
We need to re-shape the intention of emergency fund, into a better plan B

Emergency is an event that we had no way of knowing it was coming, which has a major impact on our family, if we do not cover it. (Examples)
- Insurance deductibles
- Atypical medical
- Accidents
- Job loss or cut back
- Atypical car maintenance (blown engine, transmission, towing)

Family rules to consider:
-Always agree when we are using it
-Sleep on the decision (when practical) 
There may be exceptions where that is not practical, like a medical emergency in a foreign country

Where do we store cash $300 in Attic






Likely scenarios:

280k, if our house averages 8% growth
Daddy sucks it up and deals with the frustrations of self, others and angst.

380k, if we invest or increase our income (better than our current plan aka Jenny earns something)

I earn very little, we eat our own net worth in 2-3 years. Tully launches the rest of the Ivany's are desperate
I die

# Finance
Do I buy options.
Basic math with last option
12000 x 0.30 = 3600 
amounts to 5760 or 2160 profit 60%
Shareholder report 3x ARR / # shares would be a 5x return

	Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR)
The interest rate is often called the "discount rate" when solving for assuming future value is a given
Aka:
internal rate of return
equivalent rate of return
discount rate
compound annual growth rate
