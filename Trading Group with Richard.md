If you're interested, we could form a trading group sometime in the future when you're comfortable enough to quit your job.

Here's my thoughts on this...
The strategy has these characteristics per trade:

1) High-probability, capped profit, unlimited risk - this is a same parameters that institutional traders/market makers operate and is the group that takes the other side of retail trades.  95% of losing retail traders' capital flows to these kind of strategies which haven't changed since the 70s/80's, when the current generation of senior traders started.
2)  High-probability also means that this strategy doesn't care whether the security goes up or down but you cap profits.  The math for the strategy translates to unlimited risk but because you make money whether the security goes up or down, the actual risk is close to nil.
3) Expected statistically return is 25 - 45% per annum.
4) Time required for researching companies is zero - only general market research is needed since the securities traded are options on the S&P 500, Dow, NASDAQ and Russell indexes.  If capital ever gets past 500K, then only the S&P 500 index can be traded.
5) I envision each of us has the authority to trade each others' account.  After an initial period (1-2 years?), my thought is to move to having one person manage the accounts and switch every three months.
