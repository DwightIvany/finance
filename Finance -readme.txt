I need to re-shape the intention of emergency fund, into a better plan B

---


Emergency is an event that we had no way of knowing it was coming, which has a major impact on our family, if we do not cover it. (Examples)
•	Insurance deductibles
•	Atypical medical
•	Accidents
•	Job loss or cut back
•	Atypical car maintenance (blown engine, transmission, towing)
Always agree when we are using it, and sleep on the decision (there may be exceptions where that is not practical, like a medical emergency in a foreign country)

Where do we store:
•	300 in Atic
•	Up Chequing baseline by 1000 from 0-1500 to 1000-2500
•	PC High interest savings
•	When greater than 10k find money market fund

	Trading Group with Richard
If you're interested, we could form a trading group sometime in the future when you're comfortable enough to quit your job.

Here's my thoughts on this...
------
The strategy has these characteristics per trade:

1.  High-probability, capped profit, unlimited risk - this is a same parameters that institutional traders/market makers operate and is the group that takes the other side of retail trades.  95% of losing retail traders' capital flows to these kind of strategies which haven't changed since the 70s/80's, when the current generation of senior traders started.

2.  High-probability also means that this strategy doesn't care whether the security goes up or down but you cap profits.  The math for the strategy translates to unlimited risk but because you make money whether the security goes up or down, the actual risk is close to nil.

3.  Expected statistically return is 25 - 45% per annum.

4.  Time required for researching companies is zero - only general market research is needed since the securities traded are options on the S&P 500, Dow, NASDAQ and Russell indexes.  If capital ever gets past 500K, then only the S&P 500 index can be traded.

5.  I envision each of us has the authority to trade each others' account.  After an initial period (1-2 years?), my thought is to move to having one person manage the accounts and switch every three months.
