	Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR)
The interest rate is often called the "discount rate" when solving for assuming future value is a given
Aka:
internal rate of return
equivalent rate of return
discount rate
compound annual growth rate

Emergency is an event that we had no way of knowing it was coming, which has a major impact on our family, if we do not cover it. (Examples)
�	Insurance deductibles
�	Atypical medical
�	Accidents
�	Job loss or cut back
�	Atypical car maintenance (blown engine, transmission, towing)
Always agree when we are using it, and sleep on the decision (there may be exceptions where that is not practical, like a medical emergency in a foreign country)
