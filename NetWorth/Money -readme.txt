Likely scenarios:

280k, if our house averages 8% growth
Daddy sucks it up and deals with the frustrations of self, others and angst.

380k, if we invest or increase our income (better than our current plan aka Jenny earns something)

I earn very little, we eat our own net worth in 2-3 years. Tully launches the rest of the Ivany's are desperate
I die
