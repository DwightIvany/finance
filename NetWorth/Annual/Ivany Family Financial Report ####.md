# Introduction

We have a tradition of financial reports that help us communicate and make decisions. This report is intended to provide insight into our financial position, encourage conversation, and inspire us to achieve the means to live a beautiful life filled with music, movement, family and friends.

This report is organized to include the following information:

- Balance of accounts
- Macro Economics
- Rate of Return
- Accomplishments and Annual Performance
- Notable actions
- Our Future & Goal Setting
# 1. Balances

## ​Account Balances by Category

We now have a short list of liabilities, balanced against one notable with several modest tangible assets that are hard to value.

![[Account Balances by Category.png]]Our only notable liabilities are our mortgage and Tully's fund (LoC). We have Line of Credit (LoC) at CCCU, Simplii, and TD Visa, which we have been zeroing out each month.

Our one notable asset is the house and land; with a modest amount in Jostle stock; TFSA, and a token value in vehicles.
# 2. Macro Economics

The finances of our family rest within the trends of Canadian and World economic trends. Our employ-ability rests within the job market largely set by the unemployment rate. Our costs of borrowing is closely tied to prime. Any returns we get on investments will likely co-correlate to the S&P and real estate for the region.

Inflation has become one of the most dominate topics of macro economics. What will the deliberate cooling of the economy mean for us?
The unemployment rate is hinting towards a normal job market.

This has been an exceptional year in the stock market, in which we modestly participated and exceeded the market.

# 3. Rate of Return

Our net worth has grown an impressive Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 26.7% over the past 5 years.

Bringing us from $153k starting **todo** to $500k at ending **todo**.

Our rate of return on my self directed. Going from $5000-6800. We are unlikely to do as well next year, as we have been so far a head of the market. This out performed the S&P.

## Stock
We have a modest amount of stock, and a much notable amount of stock options in Jostle.
Approximate value **$16,500**
# 4. Accomplishments and Performance

We have often reviewed our accomplishments within the following categories:

- Wealth building
- Being debt free
- Living a beautiful life
- Learning

When practical we should compare these to quantifiable goals. It is interesting that we can consider soon being truly debt free. We will need to consider debt vs leverage. Wealth building will soon be soon much more than our property.

## ​Wealth Building

### ​Target Balances

We have been close to our target balances. Because of the nature of annual property assessments, our targets are more linear and our evaluation more step wise.

## ​Growing Net Worth

A review of our Net Worth over the past several years plotted with our target.
## Cash Flow

This measurement provides significant insight into our short term management of our money, which feeds our long term plans. Any unusual patterns should be discussed, and understood. This shows a clear pattern of debt reduction.

## ​Long Term Savings

We essentially don't have any until we decrement our liabilities, or change our strategy.

## ​Short Term Savings

We shall hold only a modest amount of savings as part of our monthly cash flow. We have abundant access to cash through LoC.

## ​T. Ivany Funds

The kids are essentially unfunded with essential float. Tuskar should elevate to reasonable expense petty cash, and debt card access. Tully is essentially banking an inverted LoC (he decides how much that we do not hold on our flex-line and we pay him monthly interest.

## ​Debt Free

We have long aspired to reduce the stress of debt; however, home ownership has saddled us with a mortgage. This year we reduced our debt by about **$22k.**

## ​Live a Beautiful Life

Being mindful about our money helps us find the right balance between the present and the future so that we are able to live a beautiful life today, and invest in our future so that tomorrow can be better. What can you tell us about living a beautiful life this past year?

## ​Vacation

Australia!

## ​Simplified Budgeting and Tracking

We have compromised on a very loosely budgeted life, and are not imposing time restrictive tracking. This should be reconsidered.
